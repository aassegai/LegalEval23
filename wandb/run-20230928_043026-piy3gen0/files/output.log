Some weights of the model checkpoint at law-ai/InLegalBERT were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (5076 > 512). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
Some weights of the model checkpoint at xlnet-base-cased were not used when initializing XLNetModel: ['lm_loss.weight', 'lm_loss.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing XLNetModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
