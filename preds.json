medical evidence which","though","not as important as the two aspects mentioned above","may also be referred to.","The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas.,There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home.","Within less than 5 minutes","Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert.","The post-mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi's stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue.","Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza.","But even there","Dr. Pandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi","its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun-shot injuries.","Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited","his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true.","This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi","along with his children","to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9","1972.","Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field","leave alone making a Panchnama thereof","the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis.","The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these (1) Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging.","(2) Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence but Bal Kishore was not able to mention the name of even one of them and it is common ground that the Investigating officer did not record the statement of any of them.","(3) Jhabboo Singh","Shyam Lal Brij Bhushan and Mangali Prasad reached the scene of offence even before the appellants had fled away but none from amongst the first three was examined by the prosecution.","Mangali Prasad was examined as an eye-witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court.","(4) Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash","the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness","Mangali Prasad's evidence shows that immediately after the firing","Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki.","What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because","one

murder of Ram Sanehi but he surrendered along with the 13 or 14 other accused against whom Pooran Lal had filed a complaint.","In so far as Shyam Narain is concerned","the High Court is wrong in saying that he managed somehow to get himself arrested.","The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught","he would have been run over by the two trains coming from Kanpur and Farrukhabad.","This was hardly any sensible way of making an \"arrangement\" for himself","as directed by Subhash.","It is

The circumstances should unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused; 3. The circumstances should be linked together in such a manner that the cumulative effect of the chain formed by joining the links is so complete that it leads to only one conclusion i.e. the guilt of the accused; 4. That there should be no probability of the crime having been committed by a person other than the accused.","12. It is in the light of the aforesaid law that we have to consider the evidence and the circumstances relied upon by the courts below.","13. In a case based on circumstantial evidence it is always better for the courts to deal with each circumstance separately and then link the circumstances which have been proved to arrive at a conclusion.","Unfortunately, in this case, though a reference has been made to some circumstances, the circumstances have not been discussed separately.","Therefore, we propose to discuss the various circumstances relied upon by the prosecution: 1.","LAST SEEN TOGETHER","As far as this circumstance is concerned, the same stands proved.","It is the case of all that Room No. 203 in Meena Guest House was hired by the two accused and the deceased.","Venki came at about 9.30 p.m., but he left at 10.15 p.m. Thereafter the lodge was locked.","Therefore, this circumstance is proved.","Though this circumstance is proved, we must also look into the circumstances under which the accused were last seen together with the deceased.","The case of the prosecution is that it is the accused who took the deceased to the room with the intention of killing him since the accused Siva suspected that R (PW10) was having an affair with the deceased.","However, the manner in which the accused reached Chennai and the guest house in question suggests a total different story.","The maternal uncle of the deceased (PW1) states that one Jeyaraj, an employee of PW5 informed him over the phone at about 6\/7 p.m. on 30.10.2004 that the deceased Arun along with his friend Siddharth was coming to stay in the night with PW1 at Chennai.","A few minutes later, PW1 talked to his nephew Arun, who also told him that he would be coming to his uncle's house but did not come.","Siddharth is the son of Gomti Pandian (PW7).","According to her, Siddharth told her that he was going to Chennai along with his friend Arun (deceased) to purchase some clothes.","She was reluctant to send her son with his friend but then she talked to Arun who told her that they would be going to Chennai by bus and convinced her to send Siddharth with him.","She dropped Siddharth at the bus stand.","Later she came to know that her son Siddharth had gone to Chennai along with the deceased Arun and three other persons in a car which had met with an accident.","She was informed about this by Kala Devi (PW8), whose son Mathesh had also travelled in the same car."],"STA":[],"PRE_RELIED":[],"PRE_NOT_RELIED":[],"RATIO":[],"RPC":[],"NONE":[]},"66":{"PREAMBLE":[],"FAC":[],"RLC":[],"ISSUE":[],"ARG_PETITIONER":[],"ARG_RESPONDENT":[],"ANALYSIS":["Thus, it is clear that it was Arun (deceased), who convinced Siddharth's mother to send Siddharth with him.","This witness also stated that later her son informed her that the car had met with an accident and, thereafter, he and Mathesh did not proceed to Chennai and returned to their homes.","PW8 states that her son Mathesh had told her that he was going to Coimbatore.","Next morning she received a call from her brother's son.","He told her that the car in which Mathesh was travelling had met with an accident.","She was also told that Mathesh along with his friends Siva, Chandru, Siddharth and Arun came to the house of her brother and thereafter Mathesh returned to home.","Thus, it is clear that Siddharth and Mathesh were also travelling in the car and they would have also gone to Chennai but for the fact that the car met with an accident.","Thereafter, Siddharth and Mathesh did not proceed further and returned to their homes.","As such, it is clear that it was not the accused, who had organised the trip but it was the deceased, who had organised the trip and, therefore, it cannot be said that the accused had taken the deceased to the guest house with the intention of killing him.","This assumption by both the courts below is based on no evidence.","2.

Baskaran (PW11), who is Professor and Head of the Department of Legal and Forensic Medicines, Royapettai Government Hospital, Chennai clearly shows that after chemical analysis it was found that the amount of the offending substance found in the blood of the deceased would be equal to injecting 40 ml of Tidijesic.","Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that the deceased died due to overdosing of drug.","PW11 stated that if a 20 ml syringe is used then about 40 ml of Tidijesic could be injected in two attempts.","However, if a 5 ml syringe is used, it would require 810 attempts.","He clearly states that he cannot tell when and how this 40 ml Tidijesic was injected into the body of the deceased.","He also could not state what time the death had occurred.","He also stated that it takes 6 to 24 hours for the drug to take effect and this would further depend upon the quantity of the drug, the physique and the actions of the person injected.","Therefore, his statement does not help us with regard to the time of death or with regard to the number of attempts in which the drug was injected into the body of the deceased.","Even in the postmortem report the approximate time of death has not been indicated.","Dr. A.N.

different kinds of firearms were used by the assailants of Ram Sanehi.","Injury No. 1 was caused by a bullet and that is clear not only from the description of the injury but from what Dr. Pandiya has stated in his evidence.","He says: \"The bullet, which had entered through injury No. 1 went out straight after emerging from injury No. 7\".","Injuries Nos. 2 and 5 were caused by pellets.","This

an after thought and in the circumstances difficult to accept.","Thus in another important respect, the medical evidence falsifies the case of the prose cution.","There is another aspect of the medical evidence which, though, not as important as the two aspects mentioned above, may also be referred to.","The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas.","There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home.","Within less than 5 minutes, Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert.","The post-mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi's stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue.","Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza.","But even there, Dr. Pandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi, its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun-shot injuries.","Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited, his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true.","This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi, along with his children, to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9, 1972.","Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field, leave alone making a Panchnama thereof, the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis.","The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these (1) Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging.","(2) Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence

examined as an eye-witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court.","(4) Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash, the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness, Mangali Prasad's evidence shows that immediately after the firing, Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki.","What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because, one Virendrapal had

that he managed somehow to get himself arrested.","The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught, he
